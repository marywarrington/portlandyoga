      <h2>Yin</h2>
      <p>You're newer to the practice of yoga or perhaps returning to it after an injury, pregnancy, or other life event. You will likely enjoy Yin yoga which focuses on a quiet, meditative practice. Yin poses are passive, meaning you’re supposed to relax muscles and let gravity do the work</p>
    </div>

    <div id="result2">
      <h2>Hatha/Vinyasa</h2>
      <p>You have some experience with yoga and are mostly injury-free. You are open to learning more about yoga, its language and philosophies.By definition, hatha is a physical yoga practice. Classes described as “hatha” on studio schedules are typically a basic and classical approach to yogic breathing exercises and postures. Vinyasa, however, is a more athletic yoga style developed from Ashtanga and doesn’t stick to the same sequence of poses each time like ashtanga does, so the style varies depending on the teacher. Classes called “vinyasa” or “flow” in your gym or studio can be vastly different but in general stem from this movement.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="result3">
      <h2>Bikram</h2>
      <p>You love fitness and are always looking for fun and challenging ways to get some exercise. You’d like to figure out what types of poses you can challenge yourself with next. Bikram features yoga poses in a sauna-like room. The heat is cranked up to nearly 105 degrees and 40 percent humidity in official Bikram classes. If it’s called “Bikram” (for inventor Bikram Choudhury), it will be a series of 26 basic yoga postures, each performed twice.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="result4">
      <h2>Ashtanga</h2>
      <p>You’re open-minded and athletic by nature, and you perhaps have a deep connection to yoga already. Ashtanga involves six established and strenuous pose sequences — the primary series, second series, third series, and so on — practiced sequentially as progress is made. Ashtangis move rapidly, flowing from one pose to the next with each inhale and exhale.</p>
